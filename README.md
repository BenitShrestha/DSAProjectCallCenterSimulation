This is a Call Center Simulation Project done using Python's Simpy library in conjuction with Random and Numpy libraries.
The project is based on the general operation of an actual call center i.e customer waits in queue to enter call, enter the call, gets support and it finishes in some time, customer leaves the call.
These 4 criteria need to be fulfilled for a customer to be considered handled by the Call Center Simulation.
